# predictive-analysis---song-ratings

The goal of the project is to predict the popularity rating using features of the song, the dataset given has contains about 20,000 popular songs and their auditory features.

1.	Data wrangling / feature engineering : clean the dataset and transform into usable format, retrieve key features for future analysis through feature engineering.
2.	Hyper tune : pick the choice of regression model (XGBoost in this case) and create hyperparameter tune grid for optimized performance  based on chosen error metric (RMSE)
3.	XGBoost model : train the model with optimal parameters
